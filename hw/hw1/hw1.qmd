This HW is just to warm up on numerics and plotting. 

You should add any code you write, and the plots you generate into your Github
repository for this class. 

## Problem 1

Consider the integral 
$$
\int_0^z \frac{dz}{\left[\Omega (1+z)^3 + (1-\Omega) (1+z)^{3/2}\right]^{1/2}}
$$
where $\Omega$ is a parameter between 0 and 1. Note that this integral defines a function 
of $z$.

Write code to numerically integrate this integral for a given value of $\Omega$ and $z$.
Plot the result as a function of $z$ (between $0<z<1$) for $\Omega=0, 0.3, 0.7, 1$.
Make sure to label the axes of your plot.

Also include on your plot the analytic results for $\Omega=0$ and $\Omega=1$.

You can use any approach to integrate the function that you like (i.e. you do not 
need to write the integration routine from scratch).
