#  Lecture 1 : Outline

- Class Overview
- Isotropy and Homogeneity
	- local isotropy implies Hubble like flow
	- isotropy + no privileged observer => homogeneity 
		- Both of these are from Peacock
- Definition of Redshift
- Discussion of Hubble's law
	- Hubble's constant; dimensional analysis with H - Hubble time and distance.
	- $H = 100h$
- Units
	- Observationally relevant units : parsecs etc.
	- natural units
- Start discussing the FLRW metric


## Reading
(approximate)

I didn't do a full survey of cosmology, but I would recommend reading the introductory chapter of either textbook.
