#  Lecture 2 : Outline

- Discussion of the FLRW metric
	- Different forms of the metric
	- Comoving coordinates
	- Conformal time
- Trajectories in an expanding Universe
	- Relationship between redshift and scale factor
	- wavelength redshifting
	- doppler shifts, velocity decays
	- lagrangian view 
		- comoving velocities decay as $a^{-2}$ for non-relativistic particles, $a^{-1}$ for relativistic particles
		- physical velocities decay as $a^{-1}$ for non-relativistic particles, $a^{0}$ for relativistic particles
